          What is the Disease Diagnosis Recommendation System?
        </button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            The Disease Diagnosis Recommendation System is a tool that diagnoses
            diseases based on user-provided symptoms and offers medicine, diet,
            and exercise recommendations.

        <button class="faq-question">
          How does the diagnosis process work?
        </button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            The system analyzes the symptoms entered by the user and matches
            them with medical data to identify potential diseases. Based on
            this, it provides suggestions for treatment and lifestyle
            adjustments.

        <button class="faq-question">
          Is this platform a substitute for professional medical advice?
        </button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            No, the platform is a supplementary tool for personal health
            management. It is not meant to replace the diagnosis or treatment
            provided by licensed healthcare professionals.

        <button class="faq-question">
          What kind of data is needed for diagnosis?
        </button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            The platform requires information about your symptoms, such as
            fever, cough, fatigue, etc. It then uses this data to provide
            relevant health recommendations.

          How accurate are the recommendations?
        </button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            While the system is designed to be accurate based on data and
            algorithms, it is not foolproof. The recommendations are based on
            general medical knowledge and should be followed up with
            professional consultation.
